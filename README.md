# Community-Detection-in-Complex-Networks
This project focuses on finding communities in multilayer networks using algorithms like Greedy Modularity Maximization, Spectral Clustering, and Louvain Method. It analyzes relationships between nodes, calculates metrics like modularity and density, and compares methods to understand how networks are structured and connected.
